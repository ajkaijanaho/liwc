This is liwc, version 1.21.

liwc is a collection of programs to manipulate C source code,
originally written by Lars "liw" Wirzenius.

ccmtcnvt converts C++ comments (// foo) to C comments (/* foo */).
rmccmt removes C and C++ comments.
entrigraph converts single characters to trigraphs.
untrigraph converts trigraphs to single characters.
cstr prints string literals in C programs.

You need the Publib library (see http://code.google.com/p/publib/) and
a <unistd.h> that declares getopt. Once you have these (or hack the
source to avoid them), you can compile with "make" and install with
"make install".

This is liwc, version 1.8.

liwc is a collection of programs to manipulate C source code.

ccmtcnvt converts C++ comments (// foo) to C comments (/* foo */).
rmccmt removes C and C++ comments.
entrigraph converts single characters to trigraphs.
untrigraph converts trigraphs to single characters.
cstr prints string literals in C programs.

You need my Publib library and a <unistd.h> that declares getopt
to build. Once you have these (or hack the source to avoid them),
you can compile with "make" and install with "make install".

Please send all bug reports by electronic mail to:
    liw@iki.fi

.SH NAME
ccmtcnvt \- convert C++ comments to C comments
.SH SYNOPSIS
ccmtcnvt [-hv] [--help] [--version] [file ...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This program converts the C++ style comments into traditional C style comments.
C++ allows comments of that begin with `//' and end with the next newline,
but they weren't introduced to the C language until the 1999 version
of the C standard.
Some C compilers alre3ady accept these,
but for those who don't, you can use this utility to convert them.
.SH BUGS
ccmtcnvt assumes that the input is syntactically correct C code (except for
the comments).
